# Image Face Counting Program

This application aims to allow its users to easily identify how many faces are in a picture that they have taken. The app has a web interface which allows its user to take a picture right from their web browser. Once the picture is taken, the user will be redirected to a page where they can see all of their pictures as well as how many faces were determined to be in the picture. This application utilized Docker and containers in order to increase compatibility as well portability across the board
